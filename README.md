### Welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹
In my repositories you can find most of the work I've done in the last two semesters. I recommend to take a look at the machine learning stuff, since it's written in python and done in jupyter notebooks (it looks really fancy in github :grin:) 

Each Repository resembeles one lecture I took part. Further READMEs in each repository will guide you through.
