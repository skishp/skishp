### Welcome to my github profile 👋
In my repositories you can find most of the work I've done in the last two semesters. I recommend to take a look at the machine learning stuff, since it's written in python and done in jupyter notebooks.

Quick overview of the repositories currently available: 
* High Performance Computig
* Numerical Methods of Data Science
* Computer Vision 1           
* Learning System 1           

Have fun looking through my repositories 👍😁
