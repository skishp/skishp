### Welcome to my github profile 👋
In my repositories you can find most of the work I've done in the last two semesters. I recommend to take a look at the machine learning stuff, since it's written in python and done in jupyter notebooks (it looks really fancy in github 😁) 

Each Repository resembeles one lecture I took part. Further READMEs in each repository will guide you through. 

Since I just started recently to upload my code/work 😅 to github the repositories are currently not complete, but I will be updating the repositorys frequently. However you still will be able to get a good overview of what I've done so far.  

Quick overview of the repositories currently available: 
* Methods of Machine Learning | Lecture winter semester 2022
* High Performance Computig   | Lecture winter semester 2022
* Computer Vision 1           | Lecture summer semester 2022

Have fun looking through my repositories 👍😁
